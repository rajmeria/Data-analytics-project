AI-powered collections system – analytics project
Task 1 
In Task 1, the focus was on understanding and preparing Geldium’s customer dataset before any modeling. The dataset was reviewed to understand its structure, key variables, and overall data quality. Missing and inconsistent values were identified (such as gaps in income, credit score, and loan balance fields) and handled using appropriate imputation methods like median replacement.
Exploratory analysis was then performed to detect patterns, anomalies, and early risk indicators. Pivot tables and summary statistics were used to compare delinquent and non-delinquent customers. This analysis revealed that missed payments, low credit scores, and high credit utilization were the strongest indicators of delinquency risk. The outcome of Task 1 was a clean, reliable dataset and a clear set of risk factors to guide predictive modeling and business decisions.

Task 2 
In Task 2, the objective was to design a conceptual predictive modeling approach to forecast customer delinquency using insights from the EDA. Instead of building code, a structured modeling framework was outlined using GenAI support. A logistic regression model was selected as the primary approach due to its interpretability and suitability for financial risk prediction, with a comparison to more complex alternatives such as decision trees.
Key input features were identified based on Task 1 insights, including missed payments, credit score, credit utilization, income, and debt-to-income ratio. A high-level modeling workflow was defined, covering data ingestion, feature selection, risk scoring, and output generation.
The task also included writing a business-aligned justification for the model choice, emphasizing transparency, regulatory suitability, ease of deployment, and explainability. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation strategy was developed, outlining the use of metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, along with fairness and bias checks to ensure ethical and reliable predictions. The final deliverable was a structured Word/PDF plan describing the model logic, justification, and evaluation approach.

Task 3
In Task 3, the focus shifted from technical analysis to business communication and decision support. The predictive insights from Task 1 and the modeling framework from Task 2 were translated into a stakeholder-ready report for Geldium’s Head of Collections.
The task involved summarizing high-risk customer segments and clearly identifying the top drivers of delinquency, including missed payments, low credit scores, and high credit utilization. These insights were then converted into a SMART business recommendation, proposing a targeted early-outreach program aimed at reducing delinquency through proactive intervention.
An ethics and responsible AI section was also developed, addressing fairness risks, explainability, and data responsibility. The final deliverable was a concise, professional business report outlining predictive insights, operational recommendations, and ethical considerations to guide Geldium’s collections strategy



Task 4 
In Task 4, the objective was to design a high-level concept for an autonomous, responsible AI-powered collections system and present it in the form of an executive-style PowerPoint deck. This task focused on turning predictive insights and business recommendations into a scalable system strategy rather than building technical architecture.
The task involved outlining how the system would work end-to-end, including data inputs, risk prediction, decision logic, automated actions, and a continuous learning loop. A dedicated section defined the role of agentic AI, clearly separating what the system could handle autonomously (such as risk scoring and automated reminders) from what would require human oversight.
Strong emphasis was placed on Responsible AI guardrails, including fairness monitoring, explainability, regulatory compliance, data privacy, and human-in-the-loop controls. The final part of the task presented the expected business impact, covering both quantitative outcomes (reduced delinquency, improved recovery rates, lower costs) and qualitative benefits (better customer experience, increased trust, and scalability).
The deliverable was a PowerPoint presentation suitable for leadership review, demonstrating how AI insights could be operationalized responsibly at scale.
